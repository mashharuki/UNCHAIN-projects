### üê£ Understand How Fees Work During Swap

In the previous lesson, we looked at how token amounts in the pool increase and decrease during a swap based on a specific calculation.

In this lesson, we‚Äôll explore how to implement a fee mechanism for users performing swaps.

Key point:

The token amount a user sends to the pool during a swap is slightly discounted internally within the AMM before the swap calculation is performed.

In this example, we apply a 0.3ÔºÖ feeÔºài.e., we calculate using 99.7ÔºÖ of the provided amountÔºâ.

Let‚Äôs walk through a concrete example.

ü¶¥ Scenario

Suppose the pool contains `10,000` tokens each of Token X and Token Y.

User A wants to perform a swap of `1,000` Token X to Token Y.

Using the formula derived in the previous lessonÔºàSituation 1Ôºâ:

![](/images/AVAX-AMM/section-2/2_2_1.png)

* y': the amount of Token Y received from the swap
* y: `10,000`
* x': `1,000`
* x: `10,000`

üêü Without Considering Fees

![](/images/AVAX-AMM/section-2/2_2_2.png)

The pool receives 1,000 Token X.
Token Y decreases by 909.

The new token amounts in the pool become `11,000` for X and `9,091` for Y.

üêøÔ∏è With Fee Consideration

The user specifies 1,000 Token X for the swap,
but internally the AMM calculates with 997 after subtracting 0.3ÔºÖÔºà3 tokensÔºâ.

The pool still receives 1,000 Token X.
Token Y decreases by 906.

The new pool balances become `11,000` Token X and `9,094` Token Y.

Compared to the no-fee case:

* The user receives less Token Y
* The pool retains more Token Y

If swapping from Y to X, the reverse occurs.

With repeated swaps and fee deductions:

* The pool accumulates extra tokens in addition to what was provided by liquidity providers
* When a provider later withdraws their share, they receive more tokens than they originally deposited

This is how liquidity providers earn fees via the swap process.

### üêî Derive the Formula Considering Swap Fees

Now that we understand the fee mechanism, let‚Äôs update the formulas from the previous lesson to include fee calculation.

ü¶ï Situation 1: Deriving y' from x'

Original formula:

![](/images/AVAX-AMM/section-2/2_2_1.png)

To account for a 0.3ÔºÖ fee, we use 0.997x' instead of x'.

Since Solidity cannot handle decimals, we scale everything by 1,000Ôºà3 digits upÔºâ:

![](/images/AVAX-AMM/section-2/2_2_4.png)

Dividing both sides by 1,000 gives us:

![](/images/AVAX-AMM/section-2/2_2_5.png)

üê¨ Situation 2: Deriving x' from y'

Original formula:

![](/images/AVAX-AMM/section-2/2_2_6.png)

Again, reduce x' by 0.3ÔºÖ and scale by 1,000:

![](/images/AVAX-AMM/section-2/2_2_7.png)

Dividing numerator and denominator by 1,000:

![](/images/AVAX-AMM/section-2/2_2_8.png)

Then divide both sides by 997:

![](/images/AVAX-AMM/section-2/2_2_9.png)

Now we have the correct formula to calculate x'.

These fee-aware formulas will now be implemented inside the AMM contract.
