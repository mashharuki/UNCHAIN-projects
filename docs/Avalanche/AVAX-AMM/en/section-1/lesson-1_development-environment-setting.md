### ‚úÖ Set Up Your Development Environment

Here is the overall structure of this project:

1\. **Create a Smart Contract**

* Implement AMM logic on a smart contract so that users can swap tokens on-chain.
* Development will use a local `Ethereum` chain.

2\. **Deploy the Smart Contract to the Blockchain**

* Deploy the smart contract to `Avalanche`'s `Fuji C-Chain`.
* People from all over the world will be able to access your smart contract.
* **The blockchain acts as a server.**

3\. **Build the Web Application ÔºàdAppÔºâ**

* Users will be able to interact with your deployed smart contract via a website.
* Smart contract implementation + frontend user interface = Let‚Äôs complete the dApp üéâ

First, you‚Äôll need to install `node` and `yarn`.
If you haven‚Äôt already, install them using the links below.

It‚Äôs recommended to install `node v16`.

* [Node.js](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/setting-up-the-environment#installing-node.js)
* [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

Let‚Äôs start by creating a folder for this project. Navigate to the directory where you want to work, and run the following commands:

```
mkdir AVAX-AMM
cd AVAX-AMM
yarn init --private -y
```

A `package.json` file will be generated inside the AVAX-AMM directory.

```
AVAX-AMM
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
```

Now, update the `package.json` file to the following:

```json
{
  "name": "AVAX-AMM",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "AMM dApp",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": {
    "packages": ["packages/*"]
  },
  "scripts": {
    "contract": "yarn workspace contract",
    "client": "yarn workspace client",
    "test": "yarn contract test"
  }
}
```

Let‚Äôs review the contents of the `package.json` file.

To create a monorepo, we‚Äôre using the [Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) feature of the package manager.

This allows all packagesÔºàcontract and client in this caseÔºâto be installed in one go with a single `yarn install`.

The **workspaces** section looks like this:

```json
"workspaces": {
  "packages": [
    "packages/*"
  ]
},
```

And the commands to access each workspace package are defined like this:

```json
"scripts": {
  "contract": "yarn workspace contract",
  "client": "yarn workspace client",
  "test": "yarn contract test"
}
```

Thanks to this setup, you can execute commands from the root directory without navigating into each package folder.
(However, each package must have a `package.json` file with the relevant commands defined. Otherwise, an error will occur. We‚Äôll create those files later.)

```
yarn <package-name> <command>
```

Next, create a TypeScript configuration file `tsconfig.json`.
Since both the contract and client packages will use TypeScript, placing a `tsconfig.json` in the root allows us to define shared settings.

Ensure you‚Äôre in the AVAX-AMM directory, then run:

```
tsc --init
```

Check that `tsconfig.json` has been created. Leave the settings as default.

Now let‚Äôs create the folder structure to hold the workspace packages.

Make a `packages` directory, and inside it, create a `contract` directory. (We‚Äôll create the `client` directory later when building the frontend.)

```diff
AVAX-AMM
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
+‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/
+‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ contract/
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
```

The `contract` directory is where you‚Äôll build your smart contract.

Finally, create a `.gitignore` file in the root AVAX-AMM directory and add the following:

```
**/yarn-error.log*

# dependencies
**/node_modules

# misc
**/.DS_Store
```

At this point, your folder structure should look like this:

```
AVAX-AMM
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/
 ‚îÇ¬†  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ contract/
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
```

Now the monorepo skeleton is complete!

### ‚ú® Install Hardhat

To quickly compile„Çπ„Éû„Éº„Éà„Ç≥„É≥„Éà„É©„ÇØ„Éàand run tests locally, we‚Äôll use a tool called **Hardhat**.

* Hardhat lets you easily start a local Ethereum network for testing.
* Except that the ‚Äúserver‚Äù is the blockchain, Hardhat works like a local server.

Now, go into the `packages/contract` directory and run the following:

```
cd packages/contract
yarn init --private -y

# Install Hardhat
yarn add --dev hardhat@^2.11.2

# Install required plugins for smart contract development
yarn add --dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers@^1.0.0 @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers@^1.0.0 @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox@^2.0.0 @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@^2.0.0 @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan@^3.0.0 @types/chai@^4.2.0 @types/mocha@>=9.1.0 @typechain/ethers-v5@^10.1.0 @typechain/hardhat@^6.1.2 hardhat-gas-reporter@^1.0.8 solidity-coverage@^0.8.1 ts-node@^10.9.1 typechain@^8.1.0

yarn add dotenv@^16.0.2 @openzeppelin/contracts@^4.7.3
```

Here‚Äôs a brief overview of some key packages:

* `hardhat`: Supports development using `Solidity`.
* `@openzeppelin/test-helpers`: Useful when writing contract tests.
* `dotenv`: Used for setting environment variables, such as when deploying contracts.
* `@openzeppelin/contracts`: Provides secure smart contract implementations. A well-established framework from [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/).

> ‚úçÔ∏è: About `warnings`
> When installing Hardhat, you might see vulnerability warnings.
> These warnings can generally be ignored.
> Every time you install a library, Yarn checks for known vulnerabilities.

### üëè Start the Sample Project

Next, run Hardhat.

Make sure you‚Äôre in the `packages/contract` directory, then run:

```
npx hardhat init
```

When prompted in the terminal, respond as follows:

```
„ÉªWhat do you want to do? ‚Üí Select ‚ÄúCreate a TypeScript project‚Äù
„ÉªHardhat project root: ‚Üí Press ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù (sets the current directory)
„ÉªDo you want to add a .gitignore? (Y/n) ‚Üí y

> ‚ö†Ô∏è: Note #1
> If you‚Äôre using Git Bash on Windows, this step (HH1) might throw an error.
> Try using Windows CMD (Command Prompt) instead to install Hardhat.

Now your folder structure should look like this:

```diff
AVAX-AMM
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/
 ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ contract/

+‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
```

Let‚Äôs update the `package.json` inside the `contract` directory as follows:

```diff
{
  "name": "contract",
  "version": "1.0.0",
-  "main": "index.js",
-  "license": "MIT",
  "private": true,
  "devDependencies": {
    "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers": "^1.0.0",
    "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers": "^1.0.0",
    "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox": "^2.0.0",
    "@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers": "^2.0.0",
    "@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan": "^3.0.0",
    "@typechain/ethers-v5": "^10.1.0",
    "@typechain/hardhat": "^6.1.2",
    "@types/chai": "^4.2.0",
    "@types/mocha": ">=9.1.0",
    "hardhat": "^2.11.2",
    "hardhat-gas-reporter": "^1.0.8",
    "solidity-coverage": "^0.8.1",
    "ts-node": "^10.9.1",
    "typechain": "^8.1.0"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@openzeppelin/contracts": "^4.7.3",
    "dotenv": "^16.0.2"
  },
+ "scripts": {
+   "deploy": "npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network fuji",
+   "cp": "yarn cp:typechain && yarn cp:artifact",
+   "cp:typechain": "cp -r typechain-types ../client/",
+   "cp:artifact": "cp artifacts/contracts/ERC20Tokens.sol/USDCToken.json artifacts/contracts/ERC20Tokens.sol/JOEToken.json artifacts/contracts/AMM.sol/AMM.json ../client/utils/",
+   "test": "npx hardhat test"
+ },
}
```

We removed unnecessary fields and added several commands under `scripts` to make testing and deployment easier. We‚Äôve also added commands to copy files automatically to avoid manual mistakes.

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Run It

To make sure everything is working, run the following from the AVAX-AMM/ root:

```
yarn test
```

You should see something like this:

![](/images/AVAX-AMM/section-1/1_2_2.png)

Whenever you run tests, use `yarn test` from the `AVAX-AMM/` root.

Now, let‚Äôs clean up the folder.

First, delete `Lock.js` under the `test` directory:

1. Move to the `test` folder: `cd test`
2. Delete `Lock.js`: `rm Lock.js`

Then, delete `Lock.sol` under `contracts` using a similar method.
Be careful not to delete the entire folder.

### ‚òÄÔ∏è About Hardhat‚Äôs Functionality

Hardhat performs the following steps:

1\. **Compiles „Çπ„Éû„Éº„Éà„Ç≥„É≥„Éà„É©„ÇØ„Éà written in Solidity to bytecode**

* Bytecode is code that can be interpreted by machines.

2\. **Launches a ‚Äúlocal Ethereum network‚Äù on your computer for testing**

3\. **Deploys the compiled smart contract to the local Ethereum network**

Check the address output in the terminal:

```
Greeter deployed to: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
```

This is the address where the smart contract has been deployed in the test Ethereum network.

### üêä Upload Your Source Code to GitHub

At the end of this project, we‚Äôll deploy the app and need to upload the source code to `GitHub`.

Upload the entire **AVAX-AMM** folder.

This will be useful for future development as well, so let‚Äôs review the upload process now.

If you don‚Äôt yet have a `GitHub` account, create one using [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github).

If you‚Äôve never uploaded to `GitHub` before, use [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/quickstart-for-repositories) to create a new repositoryÔºàname it anythingÔºâ,
then follow the instructions to upload via terminal.
The following is a sample of commands to run from the `AVAX-AMM/` root:

```
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "first commit"
$ git branch -M main
$ git remote add origin [your repository SSH URL]
$ git push -u origin main
```

> ‚úçÔ∏è: Setting Up SSH
>
> To clone or push to a GitHub repository, you need to generate an SSH key and register your public key with GitHub.
>
> SSH (Secure Shell) allows secure remote control of machines. The key components are the private and public keys.
>
> You generate a private/public key pair on your machine and give the public key to the server.
>
> The private key must be kept secret, while the public key is shared.
>
> For SSH setup on GitHub, see [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).
