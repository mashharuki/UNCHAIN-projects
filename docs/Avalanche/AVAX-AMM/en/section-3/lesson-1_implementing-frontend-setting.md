### 🍽 Let’s Create the Frontend

In this section, we will build a frontend that interacts with our smart contract.

This time, we’ll use `TypeScript` + `React` + `Next.js` for frontend development.

* `TypeScript`: Programming language
* `React.js`: Library
* `Next.js`: Framework for `React.js`

For an overview of each, please refer to [this link](https://buidl.unchain.tech/Avalanche/AVAX-Messenger/ja/section-2/lesson-1_%E3%83%95%E3%83%AD%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88%E3%82%A8%E3%83%B3%E3%83%89%E3%82%92%E3%82%BB%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%E3%83%97%E3%81%97%E3%82%88%E3%81%86/).

### 🛠️ Let’s Set Up the Frontend

Navigate to the `AVAX-AMM/packages` directory and run:

```
yarn create next-app client --ts
```

Here, we’re using the `create-next-app` package to create a project named `client`.
The `--ts` flag specifies that we will use `TypeScript`.
The `client` directory will be created with the minimal setup required for a `Next.js` project.

At this stage, your folder structure should look like this:

```diff
AVAX-AMM
 ├── .gitignore
 ├── package.json
 ├── packages/
+│   ├── client/
 │   └── contract/
 └── tsconfig.json
```

Open the `package.json` inside the `client` directory and confirm that `"private": true` is set (just like in the `package.json` inside the `contract` directory).
If it’s not set, add it.

Now, let’s install the packages we’ll need for development. Move into the newly created `client` directory and run:

```
yarn add ethers@5.7.1 @metamask/providers@9.1.0 react-icons
```

- `ethers`: Used to interact with the smart contract
- `@metamask/providers`: Provides TypeScript types for interacting with MetaMask
- `react-icons`: Allows you to use ready-made icons in React

Let’s check that our development environment works properly.
If `node_modules/` or `yarn.lock` already exist in the `client` directory, delete them.
Then, from the root `AVAX-AMM` directory, run:

```
yarn install
yarn client dev
```

Open your browser and go to:
`http://localhost:3000`
You will see the default website frontend.

⚠️ We are using the **Chrome browser** for this guide. If you encounter any issues, try switching browser.

Example: Local environment displaying the website

If your frontend looks like the above, you’re good to go!

From now on, whenever you want to view the frontend, run:

- From the `AVAX-AMM` directory: `yarn client dev`
- Or from inside the `client` directory: `yarn dev`

To stop the local server:

- Mac: `ctrl + c`
- Windows: `ctrl + shift + w`

The folder structure inside `client` should look like this:

```
client
├── README.md
├── next-env.d.ts
├── next.config.js
├── package.json
├── pages
│   ├── _app.tsx
│   ├── api
│   │   └── hello.ts
│   └── index.tsx
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   └── vercel.svg
├── styles
│   ├── Home.module.css
│   └── globals.css
└── tsconfig.json
```

### 🦊 Download MetaMask

We’ll need a wallet to connect to our web application.
In this project, we’ll use **MetaMask**.

> 📓 About [Core](https://support.avax.network/en/collections/3391518-core) Wallet
> Ava Labs (the team behind the Avalanche ecosystem) supports a wallet called Core.
> Using Core can potentially enable faster transactions optimized for Avalanche.
> However, since it’s still in beta and may have bugs or frequent changes, we won’t use it here—but it’s worth keeping an eye on.

- Download MetaMask from [here](https://MetaMask.io/download.html) and install it as a browser extension.

> ✍️: Why we need MetaMask
> When a user calls a smart contract, they need a wallet containing their address and private key.
> This serves as an authentication step.

Once MetaMask is installed, let’s add the Avalanche test network.

Open MetaMask, click the network dropdown at the top, and select `Add Network`.

![](/images/AVAX-AMM/section-3/3_1_2.png)

On the settings page, enter the following details and click save:

```
Network Name: Avalanche FUJI C-Chain
New RPC URL: https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc
ChainID: 43113
Symbol: AVAX
Explorer: https://testnet.snowtrace.io/
```

If successful, you will now see `Avalanche Fuji C-Chain` in your network list.

### 🚰 Get `AVAX` Using the Faucet

Next, go to the [Avalanche Faucet](https://faucet.avax.network/) to get some `AVAX`.

This is fake `AVAX` that can only be used on the testnet.

Enter your wallet address in the form and request the tokens.
💁 You can copy your wallet address by clicking your account name at the top of MetaMask.

### 🙋‍♂️ Ask Questions

If you have any questions about the steps so far, please ask in Discord’s `#avalanche` channel.

To make the help process smoother, include the following in your error report ✨

```
1. The section number and lesson number related to your question
