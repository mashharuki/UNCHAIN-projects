### 🌍 Let’s Host on a Server

Finally, let’s host your web application on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

Vercel is a cloud platform that provides serverless hosting capabilities.

Since Vercel handles scaling and server monitoring, developers can simply deploy to Vercel to make an application public and operational.

For a detailed explanation of Vercel, please see [this article](https://zenn.dev/lollipop_onl/articles/eoz-vercel-pricing-2020).

First, upload your local files to GitHub.

If you have not yet uploaded them, open your terminal, move to the `AVAX-AMM` directory, and run the following:
⚠️ Make sure that `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore` file.

```
git add .
git commit -m "upload to github"
git push
```

Next, confirm that the files and directories from your local `AVAX-AMM` are reflected in the GitHub `AVAX-AMM` repository.

After creating a Vercel account, follow these steps:

1\. Go to the `Dashboard` and select `New Project`.

2\. In `Import Git Repository`, connect your GitHub account, select your repository, and click `Import`.

3\. Create the project.

Ensure that:

- `Framework Preset` is set to `Next.js`
- `Root Directory` is `packages/client`

4\. Click the `Deploy` button.

Vercel is linked with GitHub, so it will automatically redeploy whenever GitHub is updated.

After a short while, once the build is complete, you will see a message and a home screen like this:

The displayed home screen section is a link — click it to open your dApp in the browser 🎉
